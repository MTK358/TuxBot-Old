# ToBeFree's TuxBot Feature list
# ------------------------------
# This is a list of everything I
# could think of as new functions
# for TuxBot.
# These functions may be really
# hard to implement, so do not use
# this list as a "ToDo"-list.
# Use this list as a list of
# maybe impossible-to-realize
# suggestions of a Python-noob.
# ------------- ;) --------------
# If you want to add your own
# ideas, do that, but please
# use "I (NAME)" if you write
# about yourself.
# Send new versions of this file
# to me (ToBeFree). I will replace
# the 
# freiwuppertal.de/tuxbotfeatures.txt
# file.
# -------------------------------

- Characters should be removed from the input. "Hey its cool" should be the same as "Hey, it's cool!".
-- if this function is not implemented, it will be nearly impossible to "talk" with TuxBot using predefined sentences.

- I (ToBeFree) will add a lot of questions and answers to TuxBot, some funny, some helpful. Here are some examples:
-- Q: !help Windows crashed -- A: Use "format c: /x" to get rid of all your problems! :)
-- Q: !help Python -- A: [some] [helpful] [links] ;)
-- Q: !wikipedia WHATEVER -- A: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATEVER] :-)

- To be able to add questions and answers, there has to be a relatively easy system I can use to add them.
-- I am a python noob, but I really want to code at least /some/ things in this bot. So I need the possibility
--- to do that easily. ;)

- Do you want to publish TuxBot under a free license?
-- like GPL?
-- like CC-by-nc-sa?

- I (ToBeFree) and LinuxUser324 need read+write permissions to the github; also, if I need to create an github-account
-- to be able to write, I will do that.

- TuxBot has a big problem that needs to be solved before he is regularily used in the chat: He listens to everyone.
-- That means:
-> Every user can use !quit.
-> Every user can talk to him.
--- While the first thing is really bad, the second thing is what we want. So we need to add the possibility to make commands
--- "voiced-people-only" or even "operator-only". And the majority of commands needs to be "for everyone".

- Shall we add the github-link to the #linux topic? I (ToBeFree) would like that, but there is a condition:
-- Only LinuxUser324, me (ToBeFree) and Colson should be allowed to modify the code.

I (LinuxUser324) think that it might be a good idea. Also, someone modifying it is not an issue since GitHub won't let them without my permission.

- Colson needs to tell me (ToBeFree) how to use github xD

- Maybe TuxBot should not only listen to "!command" commands. He should also answer if somebody - for example - says:
-- "TuxBot is cool"
-- "TuxBot is stupid"
-- "TuxBot, COMMAND"
-- ...

- Variable-based commands to add:
-- !time
-- !date
-- !xkcd (<-- random xkcd comic, if possible)
-- !xkcd-linux (<-- random xkcd comic featuring Linux, Windows, free software, ... - may be hard to implement)

(LinuxUser324) It's actully not hard to implement, but it means that someone needs to look through all the xkcd comics and find all the Linux-related ones.

-- !xkcd-geek (<-- random xkcd comic you only understand if you are a really, really big geek/nerd.)
-- !wikipedia-random (<-- random Wikipedia article)
-- !wikipedia COMMAND (<-- as mentioned above, give out a Wikipedia link.)
-- !wikipedia-ARGUMENT COMMAND (<-- Output link: "http://ARGUMENT.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMMAND")

---- As I (ToBeFree) said at the beginning, feel free to add your own ideas, but please use "I (NAME)".

- I (LinuxUser324) think that it might be a good idea to have commands to set things like questions and answers (rather than hard-coding them), and for TuxBot to only accept such commands from ops. This means that TuxBot won't have to be taken offline to change them. If you want it to come with pre-defined answers, how about including a data file pre-filled with them in the GitHub repo?
