# ------------------------------
# ToBeFree's TuxBot Feature list
# ------------------------------
# This is a list of everything I
# could think of as new functions
# for TuxBot.
# These functions may be really
# hard to implement, so do not use
# this list as a "ToDo"-list.
# Use this list as a list of
# maybe impossible-to-realize
# suggestions of a Python-noob.
# ------------- ;) --------------
# If you want to add your own
# ideas, do that, but please
# use "I (NAME)" if you write
# about yourself.
# Send new versions of this file
# to me (ToBeFree). I will replace
# the 
# freiwuppertal.de/tuxbotfeatures.txt
# file.
# -------------------------------

- Characters should be removed from the input. "Hey its cool" should be the same as "Hey, it's cool!".
-- if this function is not implemented, it will be nearly impossible to "talk" with TuxBot using predefined sentences.

- I (ToBeFree) will add a lot of questions and answers to TuxBot, some funny, some helpful. Here are some examples:
-- Q: !help Windows crashed -- A: Use "format c: /x" to get rid of all your problems! :)
-- Q: !help Python -- A: [some] [helpful] [links] ;)
-- Q: !wikipedia WHATEVER -- A: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATEVER] :-)

- To be able to add questions and answers, there has to be a relatively easy system I can use to add them.
-- I am a python noob, but I really want to code at least /some/ things in this bot. So I need the possibility
--- to do that easily. ;)

- Do you want to publish TuxBot under a free license?
-- like GPL?
-- like CC-by-nc-sa?

- I (ToBeFree) and LinuxUser324 need read+write permissions to the github; also, if I need to create an github-account
-- to be able to write, I will do that.

- TuxBot has a big problem that needs to be solved before he is regularily used in the chat: He listens to everyone.
-- That means:
-> Every user can use !quit.
-> Every user can talk to him.
--- While the first thing is really bad, the second thing is what we want. So we need to add the possibility to make commands
--- "voiced-people-only" or even "operator-only". And the majority of commands needs to be "for everyone".

- Shall we add the github-link to the #linux topic? I (ToBeFree) would like that, but there is a condition:
-- Only LinuxUser324, me (ToBeFree) and Colson should be allowed to modify the code.

- Colson needs to tell me (ToBeFree) how to use github xD

- Maybe TuxBot should not only listen to "!command" commands. He should also answer if somebody - for example - says:
-- "TuxBot is cool"
-- "TuxBot is stupid"
-- "TuxBot, COMMAND"
-- ...

- Variable-based commands to add:
-- !time
-- !date
-- !xkcb (<-- random xkcb comic, if possible)
-- !xkcb-linux (<-- random xkcb comic featuring Linux, Windows, free software, ... - may be hard to implement)
-- !xkcb-geek (<-- random xkcb comic you only understand if you are a really, really big geek/nerd.)
-- !wikipedia-random (<-- random Wikipedia article)
-- !wikipedia COMMAND (<-- as mentioned above, give out a Wikipedia link.)
-- !wikipedia-ARGUMENT COMMAND (<-- Output link: "http://ARGUMENT.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMMAND")

---- As I (ToBeFree) said at the beginning, feel free to add your own ideas, but please use "I (NAME)".
